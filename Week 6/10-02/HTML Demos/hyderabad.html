    <p>Hyderabad is the capital of southern India's Telangana state. A major center for the technology industry
        , it's home to many upscale restaurants and shops. Its historic sites include Golconda Fort, a former 
        diamond-trading center that was once the Qutb Shahi dynastic capital. The Charminar, a 16th-century mosque 
        whose 4 arches support towering minarets, is an old city landmark near the long-standing Laad Bazaar.</p>
